Authentication Flow
1. User Accesses the Website (via CloudFront)
2. The user visits the website, which is hosted via CloudFront.
3.User Requests Authentication
When the user tries to log in, the frontend sends a request to API Gateway
API Gateway forwards this request to Okta ( Okta is authentication provider).
4. Authentication via Okta
using Okta, the user is redirected to the Okta login page.
The user provides email & password, which are validated. (non SSO)

5. User Receives an Access Token
After successful authentication, Okta returns a JWT (JSON Web Token) to the frontend.
This JWT token is used to authenticate future API requests.
6. Token Verification
The frontend includes the JWT token in all API requests.
API Gateway validates the JWT token using Okta OAuth 2.0.
If the token is valid, the request is forwarded
If authentication fails, API Gateway returns an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response.
